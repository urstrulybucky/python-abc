    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence or entity based on the class definition.\n",
    "Attributes and Methods:\n",

    "Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behavior of objects and operate on their data.\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal implementation details of an object and providing access to data only through well-defined methods (getters and setters).\n",
    "It helps ensure data integrity and provides a clear interface for interacting with objects.\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class).\n",
    "It enables code reuse, promotes hierarchical organization, and supports the concept of specialization and generalization.\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "It enables flexibility and extensibility by allowing methods to be overridden in child classes, providing different implementations.\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",

    "\n",
    "Class Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where child classes inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.\n",
    "Child classes can add additional functionality or override inherited methods as needed.\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is also possible, where a child class can inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "Method Overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, child classes can override methods inherited from parent classes to provide their own implementation.\n",
    "By overriding methods, you can customize the behavior of a specific class while maintaining the overall structure defined in the parent class.\n",
    "Class and Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to instance methods, Python supports class methods and static methods.\n",
    "Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator and operate on the class itself rather than instances of the class.\n",
    "Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and are independent of both the class and its instances.\n",
    "Abstract Classes and Interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports abstract classes using the abc module. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed.\n",
    "Abstract methods within abstract classes define method signatures that must be implemented by their subclasses.\n",
    "Interfaces, although not strictly enforced in Python, are similar to abstract classes that define method signatures to be implemented by classes.\n",
    "Composition and Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition represents a \"has-a\" relationship, where a class is composed of one or more other classes as its components.\n",
    "Aggregation is a form of composition, but the component classes can exist independently.\n",
    "These concepts promote code reuse and modular design by allowing classes to be composed of smaller, reusable components.\n",
    "Method Overloading and Operator Overloading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class.\n",
    "Python does not natively support method overloading, but you can achieve similar behavior by using default parameter values or variable-length argument lists.\n",
    "Operator overloading allows you to redefine the behavior of built-in operators (+, -, *, etc.) for your custom objects by implementing special methods like __add__, __sub__, etc.\n",
    "These advanced concepts build upon the foundation of OOP in Python and can enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of your code. "
